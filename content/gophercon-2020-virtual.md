#GopherCon is now #GoVirCon!

With increasing cases of coronavirus in the US, travel bans and restrictions holding strong likely through the end of the year, and Gopher Academy's increasing concern regarding the health and well-being of our community members, at the end of June we made a confident decision to cancel the in-person conference.

[GopherCon](https://www.gophercon.com) has always represented community, comradery and learning opportunities together as a group; and this year, we are as determined as ever to continue to offer all of this to our gopher family. With that said, we are tentatively planning a week of online programming, networking and engagement November 9th – 13th. Over the course of the next few months it's our planning committee's goal to deliver the high-quality programming and content you've come to expect.

## What Does This Mean For You?

•   GopherCon will still be a live conference with hosts, workshops, and of course, amazing presentations.

•   As you can expect, we will have many attendees who will want to make changes to their ticket(s) and/or hotel reservations. Please give our conference planning team the time and opportunity to reach out to you directly to make the process more efficient.

•   If you don't already have a ticket and would like to attend our first virtual event, tickets will be available on [www.gophercon.com](http://www.gophercon.com) soon. We will be sure to make an announcement!

We are feverishly working on the logistics for the new conference, so please give us a few weeks to solidify our plans. If you have any pressing questions or concerns, we're here for you. Otherwise, we will post additional announcements as our planning evolves.

Thank you in advance for your continued support of GopherCon!

Sincerely,

Brian Ketelsen and Erik St. Martin
