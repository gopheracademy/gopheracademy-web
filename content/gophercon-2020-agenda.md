#GoVirCon Schedule Announced

We're really excited to announce the schedule for our virtual presentation of GopherCon 2020!

Our official programming starts on Monday, November 9th and Tuesday, November 10th with our trademark [pre-conference workshops](https://www.gophercon.com/agenda?dates=1604880000000). There will be many opportunities for you to learn from the experts, whether you are just getting stared with Go or you're looking to dive deep into some advanced topics.

## Conference Program

The conference talks will begin on Wednesday, November 11th at 9:30 AM Eastern US time with [Erik St. Martin](https://erik.dev) and [Brian Ketelsen](https://www.brianketelsen.com) kicking off the day virtually. Each of the three days of the conference program will be packed with talks, tutorials, live features, and will wrap up each day with some special live streaming that you won't want to miss!

## Special Guests

We're teaming up with the GoTime podcast team to give you commentary and recaps each day, and maybe even some competitions. With those wacky GoTime people involved, who KNOWS what kinds of things may happen?

## Purchase Your Tickets!

We have three different options for tickets this year:

- Community Ticket ($100 USD)
- One-Time 20% Promo Ticket ($395 USD)
- One-Time 20% Promo plus 10% Perpetual Ticket ($595)

The Community Ticket will give you access to all the standard conference programming from Wendesday, November 11th through Friday the 13th. At $100, it's a steal!

Two additional ticket types have been created to help GopherCon survive the financial crisis that Covid-19 has caused:

The One-Time 20% Promo Ticket for $395 includes all the same programming, networking, and engagement with your fellow Gophers online Wednesday, November 11th - Friday, November 13th as the Community Ticket does. In addition, we will reciprocate your generosity with a 20% one-time conference ticket discount. This discount is valid for any future year (so far we have dates scheduled through 2024!) and is not applicable to Early Bird or workshop tickets.

The One-Time 20% Promo, plus 10% Perpetual Ticket for $595 includes all the same programming, networking, and engagement with your fellow Gophers online Wednesday, November 11th - Friday, November 13th as the Community Ticket does. In addition, we will reciprocate your generosity with a one-time 20% conference ticket discount, as well as a perpetual 10% discount for all future ticket purchases. These discounts are valid for all future years (so far we have dates scheduled through 2024!). The 20% one-time discount is not applicable to Early Bird or workshop tickets. However, the perpetual 10% discount can be utilized for any tickets purchased in the future, but cannot be combined with the one-time 20% discount.

These tickets are a win-win for you and for GopherCon. You'll get some great discounts on future in-person events, and we'll be able to continue our legendary Go conference programming despite the setbacks we've had this year.

Finally, we want to make it clear that we'll be releasing the recorded talks on YouTube like we do every year. You could skip buying a ticket and wait for the videos to come out, but that would make us really sad... and likely mean the end of GopherCon. We use the revenue from each conference to pay for the next year. We're counting on ticket sales this year to fund all the deposits required for 2021. We really appreciate your support, Gophers.
