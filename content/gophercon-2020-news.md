It's been a few weeks since our [first release about GopherCon and COVID-19](/gophercon-2020-update), so we wanted to share an update. You all are the backbone of this conference and so important to us! So we wanted to start by sharing that we have no intention of GopherCon being cancelled. However, based on the trajectory of current events, we recognize this situation has far reaching implications to everyone's personal and professional lives, so we feel it would be prudent to reschedule the conference to a later date. With that said, we've had detailed discussions with our conference venue about our options and should have more information to share the first week of April. Since GopherCon is a community event and in-person networking is an integral part of what draws us together, we suspect it will be a great way to hopefully kick-off some social "undistancing".

We hope everyone stays safe and sane during this unprecedented time. The thought of gathering with all of you later this year is making it a little easier on us!

Sincerely,

Brian Ketelsen and Erik St. Martin

_Your GopherCon 2020 Hosts_
