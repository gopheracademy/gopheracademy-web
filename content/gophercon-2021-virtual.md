With cases of COVID-19 continuing to rise throughout the US due to the Delta variant, we at Gopher Academy have made the bittersweet decision to bring GoVirCon back. As vaccines began to roll out at the beginning of 2021, we were cautiously optimistic we could meet in person by December. Unfortunately, current and emerging variants, along with extended office closures, company travel restrictions, and border closures, have led us to making this painstaking, albeit prudent, decision. Trust us, we’re as sad as you, but we promise this year will be even more exciting than the last!  

## What to Expect Next...
- GopherCon will still be a live conference with pre-conference workshops and the top-notch programming you’ve come to expect from us.
- We will take care of cancelling your hotel reservation at the Marriott Marquis San Diego Marina, without penalty, if you have already secured your accommodations.
- Paid ticket holders will receive individual emails from our conference planning team. So sit tight and they will be in touch by the end of next week.
- Thanks to the incredible support of our amazing [sponsors](https://www.gophercon.com/page/1778882/sponsors), but specifically Capital One and Microsoft Learn TV who are hosting the streaming, platform, and venue, tickets to GoVirCon 2.0 this year are free! We have a lot of great programming and fun surprises up our sleeves this year, so [register](https://www.gophercon.com/home) and join us.

If we haven’t told you lately… you’re the best community around! We had nearly 1,400 Gophers join us in the middle of what can only be described as global chaos last year and we know you’ll have our backs this year as well, thank you for your continued support.
