2016 was an amazing year for Go and for the Go community.  New conferences popped up all over the globe, and there were some amazing new projects written in Go.

2017 is already shaping up to be even more exciting.  We've heard rumors of several new regional conferences, some new books, new ways for you to learn Go, and we know Go 1.8 is just around the corner too!

I wrote this last year:

>We have said before that it takes a village to raise a Gopher.  As this village grows, we at Gopher Academy will keep doing our best to keep the Public Library stocked with great things to read and make sure the professors at the University are the best and brightest around.  That metaphor might have been a little too much.  Blame the New Year's punch.

It still rings true.  Go is not just an amazing language, but it is a community of people.  The Go Community is growing fast, but it has changed very little since the early days.  It's full of people who are willing to help, willing to teach, and willing to join together to make great things happen.

## Acknowledgements

The December Blog Series was a tremendous success with over 155,000 page views so far.  That's 50k more than last year!! I'd like to personally thank each author for taking the time to share their knowledge with the Go community.  Reading the blog every day was like opening a new present.

This year's Advent series was curated and coordinated by Damian Gryski (@dgryski).  We're indebted to him for his tireless work behind the scenes coordinating the editing and publishing of 30 posts.  Thanks Damian.  You're a Gopher Hero.  Thank you to all the editors who helped make each article more accurate, readable, and generally more awesome.

## GopherCon 2017

[https://gophercon.com/](https://gophercon.com/)

This year, the community is helping to build the GopherCon site!  You can help by jumping in on [Github](https://github.com/gopheracademy/gcon) and finding an open ticket that needs work.  We're coordinating our work on the Gopher Slack in #gophercon-web.  Join the fun and be part of GopherCon 2017 before it even begins.

Early bird tickets for GopherCon 2017 go on sale in a few weeks.  You can also submit a proposal to speak starting on January 1st.  Our CFP will be open from January 1st through January 31st this year.  That's a little earlier than last year, and a little shorter too.  Don't let your opportunity to speak pass you by.  Submit that [proposal](https://www.papercall.io/gophercon2017).  Thanks to the PaperCall team for hosting our CFP this year.

From all of us at Gopher Academy to you, our friends, readers, teachers, and community:  Thank you for 2016, and Happy New Year.
