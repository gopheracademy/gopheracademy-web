2016 has been a great year for the Go language and the Go community.  We love to celebrate the end of the year with a series fo blog posts from the community on a wide variety of topics.  

Here are the articles from our previous three years:

[2015 Posts](https://blog.gopheracademy.com/series/advent-2015/) 

[2014 Posts](https://blog.gopheracademy.com/series/advent-2014/) 

[2013 Posts](https://blog.gopheracademy.com/series/advent-2013/) 

As you can see from the quality of the past posts, you're in for a treat this year.  We've got articles lined up from some amazing Gophers on subjects ranging from controlling your BBQ grill to machine learning and everything you can imagine in between!

With the Go 1.8 beta release today, you can expect to see some interesting posts on some of the exciting changes in Go 1.8.  Don't forget to [download Go 1.8 today](https://golang.org/dl/) and test it so we can catch any pesky bugs before the February release.  This release looks like one of the best releases of Go ever, with speed improvements, garbage collection improvements and several new features -- especially around Contexts and the HTTP libraries.

We hope you'll enjoy this series.
