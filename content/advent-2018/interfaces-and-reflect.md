Interfaces are one of the fundamental tools for abstraction in Go. They store
type information when assigned a value and a program can inspect portions of
the interface structure, much like a mirror, to examine itself at runtime using
the `reflect` package.

I've found that understanding a bit about how a feature is implemented can lead
to a better understanding of how to actually use that feature.  In this post I
hope to illustrate how the reflect package uses parts of the inteface structure.

# Assigning a Value to an Interface

An inteface encodes three things: a value, a method set (itab), and the type of
the stored value.

The structure for an interface looks like the following:

When you assign an interface value all three of those sections are populated.

```
var myReader io.Reader = bytes.NewBuffer(nil)
```

interface myReader
 itab   -> Read([]byte) (int, error) 
 type   -> bytes.Buffer
 value  -> some pointer

# Examining Interface Data At Runtime with `reflect`

Once a value is stored in an inteface, you can use the `reflect` package to
examine its parts.  The `reflect.Type` `reflect.Value` types  provide methods
to access portions of the interface.  `reflect.Type` focuses purely on
operating on types and is therefore confined to the `_type` portion of the
structure while `reflect.Value` has to combine type information with the value
to allow programmers to examine and manipulate values and therefore has to peek
into the `_type` as well as the `data`.

# reflect.Type

# reflect.Value

# Conclusion

When using the reflect package, I've learned to think about it in terms of 

-------------

We usually use the `fmt` package without giving it much thought. A `fmt.Printf`
here, a `fmt.Sprintf` there and on we go. However, if you'll take a closer look,
you'll be able to get much more out of it.

Since Go is used a lot to write servers or services, our main debugging tool
is the logging system. The `log` package provides `log.Printf` which has the
same semantics as `fmt.Printf`. Good and informative log messages are worth
their weight in gold and adding some formatting support to your data structure
will add valuable information to your log messages.

## Formatting Output

Go `fmt` functions supports several verbs, the most common ones are `%s` for
strings, `%d` for integers and `%f` for floats. Let's explore some more verbs.

### %v & %T

`%v` will print any Go value and `%T` will print the type of the variable.  I
use these verbse when debugging.

```go
var e interface{} = 2.7182
fmt.Printf("e = %v (%T)\n", e, e) // e = 2.7182 (float64)
```

### Width

You can specify the width of a printed number, for example

```go
fmt.Printf("%10d\n", 353)  // will print "       353"
```

You can also specify the width as a parameter to `Printf` by specifying the
width as `*`. For example:
```go
fmt.Printf("%*d\n", 10, 353)  // will print "       353"
```

This is useful when you print list of numbers and would like to align them to
the right for comparison.

```go
// alignSize return the required size for aligning all numbers in nums
func alignSize(nums []int) int {
	size := 0
	for _, n := range nums {
		if s := int(math.Log10(float64(n))) + 1; s > size {
			size = s
		}
	}

	return size
}

func main() {
	nums := []int{12, 237, 3878, 3}
	size := alignSize(nums)
	for i, n := range nums {
		fmt.Printf("%02d %*d\n", i, size, n)
	}
}
```

will print
```
00   12
01  237
02 3878
03    3
```

Making it easier for us to compare the numbers.

### Reference by Position

If you're referencing a variable several times inside a format string, you can
reference by position using `%[n]` where n is the index of the parameter (1
based).

```go
fmt.Printf("The price of %[1]s was $%[2]d. $%[2]d! imagine that.\n", "carrot", 23)
```

will print
```
The price of carrot was $23. $23! imagine that.
```

### %v
`%v` will print a Go value, it can be modified with `+` prefix to print field
names in a struct and with `#` prefix to print field names and type.

```go
// Point is a 2D point
type Point struct {
	X int
	Y int
}

func main() {
	p := &Point{1, 2}
	fmt.Printf("%v %+v %#v \n", p, p, p)
}
```

will print
```
&{1 2} &{X:1 Y:2} &main.Point{X:1, Y:2} 
```

I tend to use the `%+v` verb most.


## fmt.Stringer & fmt.Formatter

Sometimes you'd like a finer control on how your objects are printed. For
example you'd like one string representation for an error when it is shown to the
user and another, more detailed, when it is written to log.

To control how your objects are printed, you need to implement
[`fmt.Formatter`](https://golang.org/pkg/fmt/#Formatter) interface and
optionally [`fmt.Stringer`](https://golang.org/pkg/fmt/#Stringer).

One good example is how the excellent
[`github.com/pkg/errors`](https://github.com/pkg/errors) makes use of
`fmt.Formatter`. Say you'd like to load our configuration file with and you have
an error. You can print a short error to the user (or return it in API ...) and
print a more detailed error to the log.

```go
cfg, err := loadConfig("/no/such/config.toml")
if err != nil {
	fmt.Printf("error: %s\n", err)
	log.Printf("can't load config\n%+v", err)
}
```

this will emit to the user
```
error: can't open config file: open /no/such/file.toml: no such file or directory
```

and to the log file

```
2018/11/28 10:43:00 can't load config
open /no/such/file.toml: no such file or directory
can't open config file
main.loadConfig
	/home/miki/Projects/gopheracademy-web/content/advent-2018/fmt.go:101
main.main
	/home/miki/Projects/gopheracademy-web/content/advent-2018/fmt.go:135
runtime.main
	/usr/lib/go/src/runtime/proc.go:201
runtime.goexit
	/usr/lib/go/src/runtime/asm_amd64.s:1333
```

Here's a small example. Say you have an `AuthInfo` struct for a user

```go
// AuthInfo is authentication information
type AuthInfo struct {
	Login  string // Login user
	ACL    uint   // ACL bitmask
	APIKey string // API key
}
```

You'd like to limit the chances that the `APIKey` will be printed out (say when
you log). You can print a mask (`*****`) instead of the key

```
const (
	keyMask = "*****"
)
```

First the easy case `fmt.Stringer`.

```go
// String implements Stringer interface
func (ai *AuthInfo) String() string {
	key := ai.APIKey
	if key != "" {
		key = keyMask
	}
	return fmt.Sprintf("Login:%s, ACL:%08b, APIKey: %s", ai.Login, ai.ACL, key)
}
```

And now `fmt.Formatter` which gets a
[`fmt.State`](https://golang.org/pkg/fmt/#State) and a rune for the verb.
`fmt.State` implements [`io.Writer`](https://golang.org/pkg/io/#Writer),
enabling you to write directly to it.

To know all the fields available in a struct, you can use the
[`reflect`](https://golang.org/pkg/reflect/).  package. This will make sure
your code works even when `AuthInfo` changes.

```go
var authInfoFields []string

func init() {
	typ := reflect.TypeOf(AuthInfo{})
	authInfoFields = make([]string, typ.NumField())
	for i := 0; i < typ.NumField(); i++ {
		authInfoFields[i] = typ.Field(i).Name
	}
	sort.Strings(authInfoFields) // People are better with sorted data
}
```

And now you're ready to implement `fmt.Formatter`
```go
// Format implements fmt.Formatter
func (ai *AuthInfo) Format(state fmt.State, verb rune) {
	switch verb {
	case 's', 'q':
		val := ai.String()
		if verb == 'q' {
			val = fmt.Sprintf("%q", val)
		}
		fmt.Fprint(state, val)
	case 'v':
		if state.Flag('#') {
			// Emit type before
			fmt.Fprintf(state, "%T", ai)
		}
		fmt.Fprint(state, "{")
		val := reflect.ValueOf(*ai)
		for i, name := range authInfoFields {
			if state.Flag('#') || state.Flag('+') {
				fmt.Fprintf(state, "%s:", name)
			}
			fld := val.FieldByName(name)
			if name == "APIKey" && fld.Len() > 0 {
				fmt.Fprint(state, keyMask)
			} else {
				fmt.Fprint(state, fld)
			}
			if i < len(authInfoFields)-1 {
				fmt.Fprint(state, " ")
			}
		}
		fmt.Fprint(state, "}")
	}
}
```

Let's try it out:

```go
ai := &AuthInfo{
	Login:  "daffy",
	ACL:    ReadACL | WriteACL,
	APIKey: "duck season",
}
fmt.Println(ai.String())
fmt.Printf("ai %%s: %s\n", ai)
fmt.Printf("ai %%q: %q\n", ai)
fmt.Printf("ai %%v: %v\n", ai)
fmt.Printf("ai %%+v: %+v\n", ai)
fmt.Printf("ai %%#v: %#v\n", ai)
```

which will emit
```
Login:daffy, ACL:00000011, APIKey: *****
ai %s: Login:daffy, ACL:00000011, APIKey: *****
ai %q: "Login:daffy, ACL:00000011, APIKey: *****"
ai %v: {3 ***** daffy}
ai %+v: {ACL:3 APIKey:***** Login:daffy}
ai %#v: *main.AuthInfo{ACL:3 APIKey:***** Login:daffy}
```

# Conculsion
The `fmt` package has many capabilities other than the trivial use. Once you'll
familiarize yourself with these capabilities, I'm sure you find many
interesting uses for them.
