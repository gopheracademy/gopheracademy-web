As many of us know, Go version 1.11 introduced [Go Modules](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules), a brand new dependency management 
system.

## A Little Bit About Modules

Before 1.11, our dependencies were a collection of Go packages with a single 
version number attached to all of them. As packages evolved, their versions 
were changed. Tools like [Godep](https://github.com/tools/godep), 
[glide](https://github.com/Masterminds/glide), 
[gb](https://github.com/constabulary/gb) and 
[dep](https://github.com/golang/dep) made it really easy for us to fetch all 
the packages that our apps needed, at the versions we needed.

Then, Go modules came along and changed the way we refer to dependencies. 
_Modules_ are a collection of Go packages that can have multiple versions 
attached to them at once. Most commonly, these versions follow the 
[semver](https://semver.org/) format, which the modules tooling respects.

But, module features don't stop there. Here are a few more cool features that 
I like:

- It can ingest dependency files from other dependency managers 
(e.g. `glide.yaml`, `Gopkg.toml`)
- No need to put your code into the `GOPATH` (if you don't want)
- Dependency management is built right into the `go` CLI (i.e. 
`go get` is now version aware)
- Most importantly for today, modules supports a 
[download API](https://docs.gomods.io/intro/protocol/)

## What The Modules System Still Lacks

Just like Glide, Dep, and friends, Go modules by default fetches code from 
version control systems (VCS) directly:

![direct from VCS](/postimages/advent-2018/go-modules-athens/go-modules-before.png)

The direct-from-VCS approach has served us pretty well since the beginning 
of versioned dependencies in Go, but it has led to some issues for the 
community. Here are a few that stand out in my mind:

- When Google Code shut down, we lost some packages that were important to 
the community
- The [go-bindata package](https://github.com/go-bindata/go-bindata) was 
removed from GitHub and then pushed to another repository, and everybody 
who depended it had to create a package alias
- Some packages are massive when you `git clone` them. For example, 
Kubernetes is over 250M when checked out (using `git clone --depth=1`),
 so they take a long time to fetch

### GitHub Isn't A CDN

The above issues reveal a common underlying problem. Our module _code_ is 
not separated from module _artifacts_ that get downloaded by tools. And since 
we don't have that separation, we have to write our modules using the same 
systems (the VCS hosts) as we do to serve those very same modules to the 
Gophers who depend on them.

GitHub and other VCS hosts are great tools for collaborating on code, making 
changes, and tracking history. But since we've also been relying on them to 
deliver artifacts, those features start to become limitations. And as the 
community continues to grow, these limitations will come up more and more 
often.

We need to move from fetching modules directly from VCS:

![go modules before](/postimages/advent-2018/go-modules-athens/go-modules-before.png)

To fetching modules from a content delivery network (CDN):

## The HTTP Download API

The download API is the feature of modules that lets us add a layer of 
indirection between the VCS and the module consumer. That layer of indirection 
is the CDN in the above diagram. We can design an architecture around the API 
that lets us use the same VCS tools and workflows we already use, but still 
serve module artifacts separately.

The new servers for module artifacts are called _module proxies_. They're free 
to implement the API and efficiently serve module artifacts to consumers, 
without worrying about the VCS hosting service at all.

Many of us use Git to push our code to GitHub and Git tags or GitHub releases 
to release a new version of our code. This architecture allows us to keep 
using those tools and that workflow. 

>Note: if you're not using [semver](https://semver.org) tags to release new 
versions of your module, you should start doing that now!

And by building _proxy servers_, we don't have to change anything about our 
workflow to fetch modules. A simple `go get` against a proxy server will 
fetch a module at the version of your choice.

## Introducing Athens

Now that there's a high level architecture for module proxies, the question 
is what should a proxy look like? There are two main possibilities:

- A CDN backed by static storage like a cloud blob store or a filesystem
- A server, backed by a database, that fetches modules from an upstream VCS 
host as needed

In order to not disturb workflows like discussed in the previous section, we 
need to implement the second one, and Athens is the first open source 
implementation to do that.

In other words, Athens is an immutable mirror of upstream VCS hosts. When you 
execute `go get github.com/athens-artifacts/maturelib@v1.0.0` against an 
Athens proxy, Athens will store [this code](https://github.com/athens-artifacts/maturelib/releases/tag/v0.0.1) in its 
database forever, regardless of what happens to that code on GitHub.

## Experiences with Athens

We've tested Athens out in lots of different situations:

- As a server on `localhost`
- A server just for a team's private code
- A public, global proxy (experimental)

As we've gathered feedback and reviewed our experiences in each situation, 
we've found some common benefits.

### Builds are Faster

Go modules maintains a local on-disk cache (at `$GOPATH/pkg/mod`), which of 
course makes builds faster than fetching modules from the network! But, for 
cold caches (like in CI/CD systems), builds are faster than with 
fetch-from-VCS situations.

We get speed for a pretty simple reason - Athens serves zip files with module 
code in them, and no VCS history. It's the same thing as if you ran 
`git clone --depth 1` and then zipped up the result.

### A Vendor in The Cloud

Athens holds an immutable database, so we're insulated from changes to 
upstream repositories, even if we delete the `vendor` directory. Simply 
put, that lets us delete code from our repository while still keeping our 
builds fast and, more importantly, reliable.

### HTTP Download API

Because the download API is HTTP, we can take advantage of all the battle 
tested web technologies we know and love. For example, internal teams can 
load balance across many Athens servers, and we can put a global caching 
proxy (a proxy in a proxy - inception!) in front of the public proxy.

### Federation

Federation is important to me because it promotes collaboration and open-ness. 
I don't want the community to end up with a single module registry that holds
all the code, and nobody else can participate.

The download API is the _lingua franca_ of the Go modules ecosystem and 
Athens implements it. Anyone can build their own proxy or run Athens 
themselves and participate in the module proxy ecosystem.

## Where is Athens Now?

The project started as a few lines of code I wrote one evening and has grown 
to a community of over 50 contributors across 3 continents. Even more 
importantly to me is that we've maintained a nice, supportive and inclusive 
place to be, and we all work to keep it that way.

We released a [beta](https://medium.com/project-athens/the-athens-proxy-is-in-beta-bd95abee07db) 
version about a month ago, and it's being used inside of several organizations. 
We're also working on our [beta 2 release](https://github.com/gomods/athens/milestone/3) 
and a [preview public server](https://github.com/gomods/athens/milestone/5) at 
the moment.

Feel free to follow [@gomodsio](https://twitter.com/gomodsio) on Twitter to 
keep up with these releases and other Athens news.

## Get Involved!

We spend a lot of time documenting how to set up and use Athens, so we'd love 
for you to [try it out](https://docs.gomods.io/install/) and tell us what you 
think. We'd also really appreciate 
[starring us on GitHub](https://github.com/gomods/athens) so more Gophers can 
find us.

There are [lots of ways to contribute](https://docs.gomods.io/contributing/community/participating/) to Athens, 
and we have interesting work to do. Whether you want to "lurk and learn", 
write code, or anything in between, you're welcome to join us, and we'll 
help you get started.

The above link has an exhaustive list of ways to get involved, but here are 
two super easy ways to start:

- Come chat with us in the `#athens` channel on the [Gophers slack](https://gophersinvite.herokuapp.com/)
